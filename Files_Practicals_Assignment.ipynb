        "   - These log errors when something goes wrong (e.g., division by zero or invalid data input).\n",
        "   - The `try-except` block captures specific errors and logs them accordingly.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Different Types of Exceptions**:\n",
        "   - `ValueError`: If the data is zero, which is invalid for the intended operation.\n",

        "1. **Logger Setup**:\n",

        "2. **RotatingFileHandler**:\n",
        "   - `RotatingFileHandler(\"my_log.log\", maxBytes=1e6, backupCount=3)`: This handler writes log messages to a file named `\"my_log.log\"`. The `maxBytes` parameter specifies that the log file should be rotated after it reaches 1MB (1e6 bytes).\n",
        "   - `backupCount=3`: This keeps a maximum of 3 backup log files. Older log files will be deleted once the limit is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Formatter**:\n",
        "   - `formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')`: This specifies the format of the log messages, including the timestamp, log level, and the message itself.\n",
        "   - `handler.setFormatter(formatter)`: The formatter is applied to the handler.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Adding Handler to Logger**:\n",
        "   - `logger.addHandler(handler)`: This adds the rotating file handler to the logger.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Logging Messages**:\n",
        "   - The program logs messages at various levels (`debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, `critical`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Log File Rotation**:\n",
        "- When the log file exceeds 1MB, `RotatingFileHandler` will create a new log file and append the log messages to it. The older logs will be saved in backup files like `my_log.log.1`, `my_log.log.2`, etc. (based on the `backupCount` parameter).\n",

        "1. **Opening the File**:\n",
        "   - `with open(file_name, 'r') as file`: Opens the file in read mode (`'r'`) and automatically handles closing the file after reading.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Reading Content**:\n",
        "   - `content = file.read()`: Reads the entire content of the file as a string.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Counting Word Occurrences**:\n",
        "   - `content.lower().split()`: Converts the content to lowercase and splits it into a list of words.\n",
        "   - `count(word_to_count.lower())`: Counts how many times the specified word (also converted to lowercase) appears in the list of words.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Error Handling**:\n",
        "   - If the file does not exist, a `FileNotFoundError` is caught, and an error message is printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Notes**:\n",
        "- The program handles the case where the word may appear in different cases (like \"Sample\", \"sample\", etc.) by converting the content and the word to lowercase before counting.\n",
        "- **File Path**: Ensure the `file_name` is correct, especially if you're working in environments like Google Colab, where files are stored in `/content/`."

        "2. **Error Handling in `read_file()`**:\n",
        "   - `FileNotFoundError`: Logs the error message if the file doesn't exist.\n",

        "   - `Exception`: Catches any other unexpected errors and logs them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Example Usage**:\n",
        "   - The `read_file()` function is called with a file name (`'example.txt'`), and if any error occurs, it is logged to `'file_handling_errors.log'`.\n",

        "### **Notes**:\n",
        "- The log file `file_handling_errors.log` will be created in the current working directory. You can change the path if you want it to be stored in a different directory.\n",
        "- You can also adjust the log level (`logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO`, etc.) based on the type of information you want to log.\n",
        "- The `try-except` blocks ensure that specific errors (like file not found or permission issues) are logged with a detailed message."
